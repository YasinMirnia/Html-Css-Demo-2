      <h1>Hey, I'm Yasin Mirnia</h1>
      <p>
        A frontend developer who<br />
        crafts technology to create a sleek and functional end product,<br />
        Codes on "<a href="#">GitHub</a>", <br />
        and connects on "<a href="#">LinkedIn</a>".
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently on my journey to learn frontend development, and I am
        eager to collaborate with others.<br />
        This journey has been filled with challenges and new opportunities.
        <br />
        Learning new technologies and solving various problems has provided me
        with valuable experiences. <br />
        If you're interested in working together and want to join me on this
        path, we can support each other and benefit from our shared experiences.
        <br />
